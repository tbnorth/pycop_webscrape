# pycop_webscrape

This repository houses a presentation which you can
[view online](https://tbnorth.github.io/pycop_webscrape/).

NOTE: the presentation uses [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/),
the HTML slide show framework.  The unchanged parts of reveal.js are
brought in in a single commit.
